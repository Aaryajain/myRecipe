take a bowl and add:
maida , cocoa powder , baking soda to it and whisk it properly;
this makes the dry ingredients;

then take another bowl and add:
butter , white sugar , brown sugar and mix it till the mixture is light and soft
now add some vanilla extract , red food colouring to the same bowl and mix it
then, add the dry mix to it and whisk it properly;


the mixture is sandy and crumbly ; so we will take another container and add:
milk and white vinegar or lemon juice to it and let it rest for 5 mins till the milk starts to cuddle;

now add the buttermilk (formed in line no.12) to the dough and mix it;

the cookie dough is now ready;

so we put it in the fridge for 30 mins 
.... just as the dough is in the fridge for 15 mins , we start preheating the oven at 180 degrees for 15 mins..

now we take the baking tray and scoop the dough into little balls and put in into the oven for 12-15 mins at 180 degrees....
